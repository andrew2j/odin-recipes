        <h1>The World's Best Carbonara</h1>

        <img src="../img/carbonara.jpg" alt="A picture of pasta carbonara">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the original carbonara recipe from the business card of "Luciano 
            - Cucina Italiana" in Rome. Arguably, the world's <strong>best</strong> 
            pasta carbonara. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>280g spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>200g guanciale in 1,5cm cubes</li>
            <li>30g grana padano, grated</li>
            <li>20g pecorino romano, grated</li>
            <li>2g black pepper, ground</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta in boiling water as mentioned on the package.</li>
            <li>
                Fry the guanciale cubes in order to make them crispy outside and soft 
                inside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk in a bowl the egg yolks, the grana padano, the pecorino and the 
                melted fat obtained from frying guanciale.
            </li>
            <li>Let this mixture rest.</li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is cooked, stir the mixture, ground pepper, and the 
                little cubes of guanciale in a bowl, add a little pasta water, and mix 
                to get it creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plate the pasta and add ground pecorino cheese, and freshly ground
                pepper on top.
            </li>
            <li>Serve at the right temperature. Not too hot, not too cold, tepid.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PASTA: 70g of pasta per person seems like a good amount since the dish 
                is very rich. Spaghettoni, thick spaghetti, are preferred to spaghetti. 
                They take longer to cook. It gives you more time to cook the sauce 
                PLUS they are harder to overcook. Worst you could do is capellini or 
                vermicelli - they would mush and soak up too much sauce. The pasta pot 
                should be more wide than tall, especially for cooking spaghetti/oni. 
                Underseason the water (a pinch is plenty). Water level should be 1/2 
                inch (1cm) over pasta. Stirring is mandatory. Undercook the pasta by 
                2-3 minutes, this will compensate for the amount of time they spend in 
                the bain-marie afterwards.

                MEAT: Luciano cuts guanciale in cubes, not sticks. The card says 
                1cm cubes, but it's more than that. At least 1/2 inch (1,5cm), if not 
                2cm, as they shrink a bit during frying. If you've ever cooked steak 
                before, you know that obtaining a perfect medium rare center is easier 
                with a thicker piece. Overcook = dry. Cooked right = juicy. Don't go 
                high heat. Pork fat has a low smoking point. Also, if the chunks were 
                too big, they would burn outside and stay raw inside. Go medium high 
                heat to sear first, and then low. Once they are crispy on the outside, 
                get them off the heat. Room temperature is fine. Keep all that melted 
                guanciale fat, we're gonna need HALF OF IT, not all of it, for the 
                sauce later on.
            </li>
            <li>
                EGGS: Use only egg yolks (1 per person) if you want a richer, yellower 
                color. Or use whole eggs if you want it a little more traditional.
            </li>
            <li>
                BAIN MARIE / DOUBLE BOILER METHOD: Ingredients mix better if they are 
                warm, and using a double boiler, instead of just a frying pan, means 
                it will be more gentle. We'll have more control, and we'll be able to 
                stay below 65Â°C where eggs start cooking and the cheese starts 
                creating lumps. Use a large heatproof bowl over simmering water. The 
                bottom of the bowl can't touch water. Whisk hard to mimic the SABAYON 
                technique. SABAYON is a foamy, custardy dessert where eggs are 
                whisked over a bain-marie. This dish really is all about the 
                light/foamy/airy texture. Air bubbles enhance sensory properties.
                As you whisk, drizzle pork fat in there. This is the same process as 
                for HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. By gradually incorporating fat, you create a 
                foamy emulsion. Hollandaise uses clarified butter but here it's pork 
                fat.
