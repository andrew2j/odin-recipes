            This simple recipe for Brazilian Fish Stew is easy to make and takes 
            about 35 minutes, perfect for busy weeknights! Brazilians call this

            This version hails from Salvador, a bustling city on the coast of Brazil, 
            just north of Rio de Janeiro that offers up delicious seafood prepared 
            using African influences and techniques. This part of Brazil is known for 
            pairing fish with spicy chilies, lime and cooling coconut milk, a lovely 
            combination.

            <li>1 cup fish or chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups tomatoes, diced (preferably fresh)</li>
            <li>14 ounce can coconut milk (liquid and solids)</li>
            <li>more salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro, scallions or Italian parsley</li>
            <li>squeeze of lime</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse and pat dry the fish and cut into 2 inch pieces. Place in a 
                bowl. Add salt, zest from half the lime and 1 tablespoon lime juice. 
                Massage lightly to coat all pieces well. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add 
                onion and salt, and sauté 2-3 minutes. Turn heat down to medium, add 
                carrot, bell pepper, garlic and jalapeno and cook 4-5 more minutes. 
                Add tomato paste, spices and stock. Mix and bring to a simmer and add 
                tomatoes. Cover and simmer gently on medium low for 5 minutes or 
                until carrots are tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the coconut milk, taste, and add more salt if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Nestle the fish in the stew and simmer gently until it's cooked 
                through, about 4-6 minutes. Spoon the flavorful coconut broth over 
                the fish and cook until desired doneness or longer for thicker pieces.
                (You can also finish this in a 350F oven).
            </li>
            <li>Taste, adjust salt, and squeeze with lime.</li>
            <li>
                To serve, serve over rice, sprinkle with cilantro or scallions and a 
                squeeze of lime.
            </li>
            <li>Drizzle with a little olive oil if you like.</li>
        </ol>
